# Step 1: Make an HTML page

For this exercise, you'll create a mock news article using HTML. We grabbed some placeholder text from [Cheese Ipsum](http://www.cheeseipsum.co.uk/) and an image from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org). Feel free to use something else!

Open the `index.html` file and take a look. Add the following headline, byline, and text.

Here are some HTML resources:

- [Paragraphs](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp)
- [Formatting](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp)
