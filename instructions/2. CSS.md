# Step 2: Use CSS to style the page

For this exercise, you'll use CSS to style the HTML page you made during the previous section.

Look for the `<style></style>` tag on your `index.html` page. This is where you'll add CSS to improve how the page looks. We have some basic CSS in there already, feel free to modify it and get creative!

Try out some of the following:

- [Change the font for the page](https://www.w3schools.com/csSref/pr_font_font-family.asp)
- [Change the font size on the headline](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_size.asp)
- [Try changing some colors](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/default.asp)
- [See if you can improve the readability of the paragraph text with `line-height`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height)
